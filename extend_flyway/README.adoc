= Extend Flyway

Extend the official https://flywaydb.org/[Flyway]
https://github.com/flyway/flyway-docker[docker container] to install the MySQL client and add a MySQL-variant of
the `wait-for-postgres.sh` script shown in the
https://docs.docker.com/compose/startup-order/[docker-compose documentation].

This seems to work fine but requires modifying every container that has a dependency on another to add a custom
healthcheck.
